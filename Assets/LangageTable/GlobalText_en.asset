      In this mini-game
      my background and my skills are scattered throughout the level.

      

      Each
      panel will display a specific section

      

      - Use the up scroll
      to go back,

      - Use the scroll down to move forward,

      - The character
      will jump on its own

      if an obstacle arises.

      

      

      Elements
      are clickable, they will be recognizable

      to their blinking outlines.

      

      Good
      viewing.'
